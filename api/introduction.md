# Getting started

In CSML Studio, every channel generates a set of API keys that you can use to perform various operations, such as managing the bot, sending broadcasts, getting information about current conversations...

Every channel has different capabilities but all channels rely on the same API methods.

## Endpoints

All calls are to be made to `https://clients.csml.dev`.

The API is versioned, and alls must be prefixed by their version number. The most recent version is `v1`. The API is reachable on route prefix `/api`.

Hence, the complete endpoint for the API is `https://clients.csml.dev/v1/api`.
