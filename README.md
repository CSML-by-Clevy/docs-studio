# Introduction

**CSML (Conversational Standard Meta Language) is an open-source programming language dedicated to building chatbots**.

It acts as a linguistic/syntactic abstraction layer, designed for humans who want to let other humans interact with any machine, in any setting. The syntax is designed to be learned in a matter of minutes, but also scales to any complexity of chatbot.

CSML handles seamlessy and automatically **short and long-term memory** slots, **metadata** injection, and can be plugged in with any external system by means of [**channel integrations**](channels/introduction.md) or [**custom APIs**](api/introduction.md), as well as consume scripts **in any programming languages** using built-in parallelized runtimes.

## Build your chatbot with CSML Studio

The easiest way to develop CSML chatbots is by using the [CSML development studio](https://studio.csml.dev/), using a sample bot available in your library or by creating your own.

Each bot gives you a full access to the CSML framework - a set of specialized tools to make and customize your chatbots : code editor, chatbox, apps, functions and files library, analytics and channels.

## **Create your own conversational experiences**

You can create your own conversations by modifying an existing flow or [creating your own](getting-started/create-your-first-bot.md).

A flow is a CSML file which contains several steps to be followed during a conversation with a user. The first instructions have to be placed in the start step, then you can move from a step to the next one using `goto stepname`, and finish the current conversation using `goto end`. Each step contains instructions on how to handle the interactions within the step: what to say, what to remember, where to go...

For the bot to say a sentence, you just need to use the keyword `say` followed by the[ type of message](https://docs.csml.dev/language/sending-receiving-messages) you want to send.The keyword `say` allows:

* to display a message: text, questions, urls, components (image, video, audio, buttonsâ€¦)
* to simulate behaviors, such as waiting time (Wait) or message composition (Typing)

## **Manage interactions**

Like a human, a chatbot is supposed to understand and react to messages sent by the user.

In a conversational logic, CSML allows the chatbot to wait for a user answer using the keyword `hold`, and interpret the expected user input (called `event`) to trigger an action.

Here is an example of a simple interaction where the bot is asking if the user likes guitar and waiting for two specific answers in order to trigger actions.

## **Memory and local variables**

[Memory](https://docs.csml.dev/language/memory) is essential in the CSML logic. When two people are chatting, they constantly memorize and update information to be reused in future discussions.\
CSML provides two types of variables: local variables, with a very short life cycle, and persistent variables, called memories.

The memories are assigned as followed use the keyword `remember` and can be reused in every step or in a future conversation, while the local variables are executed within one step, assigned with the `use` keyword.

You can output any variable into a string value with the double curly braces.

## **Connect apps and execute your own functions**

You can select an existing integration in the apps library or add your own function coded in any language. Find a few examples in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSML-by-Clevy) and how to use functions in our [documentation.](https://docs.csml.dev/#custom-code-execution)

Once your function is uploaded, you can test it and call it in a CSML flow. [Read more about functions and apps here](getting-started/using-csml-apps/)!

## **Deploy your chatbot**

Once your chatbot is ready to chat with your users, you can select the channel you want to connect on. For example, using the [CSML Studio](https://studio.csml.dev) you can connect your bots to Slack, Messenger, Whatsapp and other channels, or use the [CSML Client API](api/api-reference/chat-api.md) to receive requests.
