Messenger is one of the most popular chat platforms, with over 1.3B users worldwide. It is also one of the platforms that democratized the use of chatbots. It has a pretty broad set of APIs and allows for some very rich message templates, which gives it a nice user experience. If you are looking to build a publicly-accessible chatbot, Messenger is definitely a solution to look at!
