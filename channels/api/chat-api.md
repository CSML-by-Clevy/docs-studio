# Chat API

## POST /chat

The Chat API allows you to send chat requests to your bot on behalf of an end user. You can send a text request, and receive the bot's response in return.

This API works synchronously by default: you will receive all of the bot's messages in one array in response to your request.

In async mode, the CSML server will send messages as they are processed by the bot, asynchronously, to an endpoint of your choice.

### Sending a chat request

You can query the Chat API by sending a simple text message for analysis. This will either continue any previous conversation or start a new one.

```bash
# replace the x-api-key and x-api-signature values with your data
curl -X "POST" "https://clients.csml.dev/prod/api/chat" \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'x-api-key: ${API_KEY}|${TIMESTAMP}' \
     -H 'x-api-signature: sha256=HMAC_SHA256(${API_KEY}|${TIMESTAMP}, ${API_SECRET}, "hex")' \
     -d $'{
            "client": {
              "user_id": "some-user-id"
            },
            "metadata": {
              "firstname": "John",
              "lastname": "Doe"
            },
            "request_id": "random-id",
            "payload": {
              "content": {
                "text": "Hello"
              },
              "content_type": "text"
            }
          }'
```

#### Valid request message payloads

The following message types are accepted \(see below for payload examples\): `text`, `image`, `video`, `audio`, `file`, `url`, `payload`, `flow_trigger`.

Additional properties can be added to the message's `content` and will be available as `event.my_added_prop` in the context of the CSML.

#### Triggering a specific flow

To trigger a specific flow, you can send the following event:

```javascript
{
  "client": {
    "user_id": "some-user-id"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "key": "value",
    "otherkey": "othervalue"
  },
  "request_id": "random-id",
  "payload": {
    "content": {
      "flow_id": "some-flow-id",
      "close_flows": true
    },
    "content_type": "flow_trigger"
  }
}
```

You can also choose to force-close any previously open conversation with `close_flows`. If you don't close previous conversations and the flow is a recursive flow \(i.e has no `hold` keywords\), then the previous conversation will be relaunched at the last available step in that flow.
