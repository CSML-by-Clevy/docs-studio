# Features

## Components

Most components are available on Telegram, however `Carousel` components are currently not supported. `Typing` components are also displayed as simple `Wait` components.

## Broadcast

You can send a broadcast to a given user by using  `_metadata.id` as their `user_id` with the broadcast API or the broadcast interface in the corresponding tab in the channel's settings. It requires that the user has already interacted with the chatbot before \(you can not simply send a message to a user's `@username`\).

You can add custom metadata as well!
