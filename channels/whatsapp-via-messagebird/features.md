# Features

## Available components

Whatsapp (via MessageBird) supports the following components:

* `Text()` or string templates
* `Object()` or JSON templates
* `Wait()`
* `Image()`
* `Video()`
* `Audio()`
* `File()`
* `Url()`

Markdown is partially supported (only **bold**, _italic_ and ~~strikethrough~~).

To send completely custom requests, use `say Object(...)` . The content of the object will be forwarded as is in the request body. For a complete reference, please visit [MessageBird's API documentation](https://developers.messagebird.com/api/conversations/#whatsapp-api).

## Limitations

### Buttons

Whatsapp has a very limited set of interactive components. Buttons for example are textual only, and your users will have to type the actual text of the button.

The mapping of `Question()` and `Button()` components to text is performed automatically. However you need to set the right `title` and `accepts` values in order to correctly match the user's input.

### Typing

The typing indicator `...` is not supported and replaced by a simple `Wait()` component of the same duration.

### Urls

The `Url()` component does not support any alternative text or title. Only the given url will be shown as is.\
For instance, the following code:

```cpp
start:
    say Url("https://www.google.com", text="Go to google")
    goto end
```

Has the following output:

### Video

You must upload videos in mp4 format. Videos hosted on Youtube, Dailymotion or Vimeo will not display (use the `Url()` component).

### Audio

You must upload audio files in mp3 format. Audio files hosted on Spotify, Deezer or Soundcloud will not display (use the `Url()` component).

### Files

There is a hard limit of 25MB for all uploaded files (including image, video and audio files).

In a `File()` component, not all file types are supported. A list of supported file types could not be found, but it is safe to recommend using very common file types only.

The file upload process happens asynchronously on Whatsapp, so messages might show out of order if there is a large upload with not enough time left for its upload before sending the next message.

### Carousel, Card

`Carousel()` and `Card()` components are currently not supported.
