# Features and message formats

Workplace Chat is very, very similar to Messenger \(except that it's grey\). Please refer to Messenger's CSML documentation:

{% page-ref page="../messenger/features.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../messenger/message-formats.md" %}

## Broadcasts

Broadcasts can be sent without any limitation to any of your Workplace Chat users, with either their valid Workplace email address or ID as the user\_id.
