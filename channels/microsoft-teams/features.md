## Broadcast API

The Microsoft Teams channel supports the [broadcast API](../../api/api-reference/broadcasts-api.md).

* The client user\_id must be set to a valid conversationId \(as returned in every conversation's metadata\).
* No broadcast can be sent to a user that has not already actively interacted with the chatbot.
