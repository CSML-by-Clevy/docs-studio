# Message formats

## Text

```cpp
say "His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy" // short form
say Text("There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti") // long form
```

The `Text` component of the Webapp channel also supports some basic Markdown:

```cpp
say "He's _nervous_, but **on the surface** he looks [calm and ready](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yhyp-_hX2s)"
```

## Typing, Wait

```cpp
say Typing(1000)
```

Obviously, `Wait` is also supported \(it simply does not display a typing indicator or anything for the given duration\).

## Image

```cpp
say Image("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560114928-40f1f1eb26a0")
```

## Question, Button

```cpp
say Question(
  "Hi! My name is:", // equivalent to title="Hi! My name is:",
  buttons=[Button("What?"), Button("Who?")]
)
```

![](../../.gitbook/assets/capture-de-cran-2020-04-30-09.51.57.png)

If you need to retrieve a specific data when clicking on either button, use the `payload` argument of the Button component:

```cpp
say Question(
  "Hi! My name is:",
  buttons=[
        Button("What?", payload="btn1"),
        Button("Who?", payload="btn2"),
  ]
)
hold
say "user clicked on button with the {{event}} payload"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The Webapp channel also supports single `Button` components. However, as cross-channel support for single buttons is not guaranteed, we encourage you to use the standard Question component instead, with a title.
{% endhint %}

## Video, Audio

The Video component supports links to mp4 files, as well as Youtube, Vimeo and Dailymotion URLs. The Audio component supports links to mp3 files, as well as Spotify, Soundcloud and Deezer URLs.

```cpp
say Video("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqBhgEQ4LT0")
```

![](../../.gitbook/assets/capture-de-cran-2020-04-30-10.01.51.png)

```cpp
say Audio("https://open.spotify.com/track/1xB3YT8Rakvnfcc1dp2kzJ")
```

![](../../.gitbook/assets/capture-de-cran-2020-04-30-10.03.55.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Standard limitations apply**: if the end user is not logged in to a valid spotify/deezer/soundcloud account, only 30s will be playable in the audio component.

For full control over the clip, prefer using a standard mp3 file URL.
{% endhint %}

## Url

The `Url` component will automatically retrieve the target's favicon if available. If a `text` parameter is present, it will be used as the component's title.

```cpp
say Url("https://www.wikipedia.org/", text="Visit Wikipedia")
```

## Carousel, Card

A `Carousel` is essentially a collection of `Card` elements A single `Card` will display as a `Carousel` of 1 element.

```cpp
do card1 = Card(
    "The Marshall Mathers LP",
    subtitle="Release date: May 23, 2000",
    text="The Marshall Mathers LP is the third studio album by American rapper Eminem...",
    image_url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/The_Marshall_Mathers_LP.jpg",
    buttons=[Button("Listen to this album", payload="marshallmatherslp1")]
)
do card2 = Card(
    "The Slim Shady LP",
    subtitle="Release date: February 23, 1999",
    text="The Slim Shady LP is the second studio album and the major-label debut by American rapper Eminem...",
    image_url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/35/Eminem_-_The_Slim_Shady_LP_CD_cover.jpg",
    buttons=[Button("Listen to this album", payload="theslimshadylp")]
)
do card3 = Card(
    "The Marshall Mathers LP 2",
    subtitle="Release date: November 5, 2013",
    text="The Marshall Mathers LP 2 is the eighth studio album by American rapper Eminem...",
    image_url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/The_Marshall_Mathers_LP_2.png",
    buttons=[Button("Listen to this album", payload="marshallmatherslp2")]
)

say Carousel(cards=[card1, card2, card3])
```
